# Electricity-Consumption-Correlation-Analysis
In this experiment, the maximum mutual information coefficient（MIC） and Pearson correlation coefficient are used to conduct correlation analysis on the influencing factors of users' electricity consumption data (history electricity consumption, temperature, holiday, month) with GEFCom2012 dataset, and the nonlinear relationship between different data features is effectively mined.Through the results of correlation analysis, feature selection is carried out, and the strong correlation features are input into the deep neural network for further analysis to reduce the redundancy calculation and realize the real-time and efficient processing of power data.
